## Input CSV Format (Tito Export)

The script directly parses [CSV exports](https://help.tito.io/en/articles/6811906-custom-exports) from **Tito**, the ticket processor used for PyBeach. A sample template is provided in `sample_attendees.csv`.

### Expected Columns

| Column Header | Type | Description / Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `What name would you like printed on your badge?` | Required | Name displayed prominently on badge. If the value begins with `*` (e.g. `*`), a blank badge is produced (ideal for walk-in attendees to handwrite their names). |
| `Ticket` | Required | Ticket tier name (e.g. `Corporate`, `Early Bird Corporate`, `Individual`, `Student`, `Early Bird Student`). Rows with ticket `Donate to PyBeach` are automatically excluded. |
| `Photo opt-out` | Required | If set to `Opt-out`, a no-photos camera icon is rendered in the top-left corner. Rows with empty values are skipped. |
| `Would you like your pronouns printed on your badge?` | Optional | If value starts with `Yes`, the attendee's pronouns are printed in the top-right corner. |
| `Pronouns` | Optional | Attendee pronouns (e.g. `She / Her`, `He / Him`, `They / Them`). Auto-formatted and capitalized. |
| `Ticket Job Title` | Optional | Attendee job title. Formatted with company or as standalone affiliation. |
| `Ticket Company Name` | Optional | Printed on corporate ticket badges (e.g. `Principal Engineer, Acme Corp`). |
| `What school do you attend?` | Optional | Printed on student ticket badges (e.g. `Student, UC San Diego`). |
| `Order Reference` | Optional | Tito order reference (e.g. `PB26-A101`), printed in 10 pt font in the lower-right area just above the ribbon. |

### Special Features

1. **Automatic Font Scaling**: Names and affiliations that exceed the badge width automatically step down in font size to prevent overlapping or truncation.
2. **Blank / Walk-in Badges**: Set the name to `*` to generate badges without a name while still including the logo, date ribbon, and cutting guides.
3. **Optimized SVG Rendering**: Vector SVG assets are cached and pre-scaled in memory, allowing large attendee lists to render quickly.
